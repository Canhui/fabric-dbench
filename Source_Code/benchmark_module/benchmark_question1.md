## 1. Research Question (about transaction arrival rate)

Does a higher transaction arrival rate means a larger throughput? Is there a necessary relationship between then? why and why not? 

#### 1.1. Method

Peer configuration

Transaction Arrival Rate: 0 TPS --> see Throughput results
Transaction Arrival Rate: 10 TPS --> see Throughput results
Transaction Arrival Rate: 20 TPS --> see throughput results
...
Transaction Arrival Rate: 50 TPS --> see throughput results 
Transaction Arrival Rate: 60 TPS --> see throughput results
Transaction Arrival Rate: 70 TPS --> see throughput results
Transaction Arrival Rate: 80 TPS --> see throughput results
Transaction Arrival Rate: 90 TPS --> see throughput results
Transaction Arrival Rate: 100 TPS --> see throughput results





#### 1.2. Reasons/Analysis

TO DO: See transaction timeout. Timeout set for validating transaction of hyperledger.
TO DO: See transaction dealy.
A large number of transactions results in a longer delay?
How to see transaction size? Transaction proposal size? 
How to see the length of a queue?
Why a higher transaction arrival rate results in a lower throughput?
